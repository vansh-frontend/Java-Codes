# Java Learning Journey

## Introduction

Welcome to my **Java Learning Journey**! üéâ

I have started learning and practicing Java during my **6th semester of BCA** at **Chandigarh University**. My primary focus is to build a strong foundation in Java and master its key concepts. This repository serves as a collection of all the Java programs and projects I am working on as I progress through this exciting journey.

## Why I Chose Java

Java is one of the most popular programming languages, known for its versatility, portability, and robustness. It is widely used for:
<!-- - **Web Development**
- **Android App Development**
- **Enterprise Applications**
- **Game Development** -->

By learning Java, I aim to:
- Understand **object-oriented programming** (OOP) concepts.
- Build efficient and maintainable code.
- Prepare for industry-level opportunities.

## Current Focus

As I practice Java, I am focusing on the following:
1. **Core Java Basics:**
   - Variables, Data Types, and Operators
   - Control Statements (if, for, while, etc.)
   - Methods and Classes
   - Arrays and Strings

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - Encapsulation
   - Inheritance
   - Polymorphism
   - Abstraction

3. **Practical Applications:**
   - Writing clean, modular, and reusable code
   - Developing simple console-based programs
   - Solving algorithmic problems in Java

4. **Advanced Topics:** *(Coming Soon!)*
   - Exception Handling
   - File I/O
   - Collections Framework
   - Multithreading

## Repository Structure

This repository contains all my Java codes organized by topics:

```
Java-Learning-Journey/
|
|-- Core-Java/         # Basics, Loops, Arrays, and Strings
|-- OOP-Practice/      # OOP Concepts and Real-world Applications
|-- Algorithms/        # Problem-solving with Java
|-- Mini-Projects/     # Small, fun projects to apply what I've learned
```

Feel free to browse through the folders and check out my progress. Each folder contains:
- **Source Code:** Java files with detailed comments for better understanding.
- **ReadMe:** Descriptions of the topic and what I learned.

## How to Run the Codes

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vansh-frontend/JAVA-CLASS.git
   ```
2. Open the `.java` files in your favorite IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
3. Compile and run the programs using:
   ```bash
   javac filename.java
   java filename
   ```
